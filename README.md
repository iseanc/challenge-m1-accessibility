# Module 1 Challenge - Refactoring for Accessibility

## Description

This project is created for a Challenge Assignment for a Web Coding Bootcamp.  SCENARIO: A (fictional client) wishes for the project codebase to follow accessibility standards to help optimize the site for search engines.

This is a practical application of Web Accessibility concepts learned in the web coding bootcamp, and an opportunity to explore Accessibility standards (e.g. WCAG 2.0) in greater depth.

HTML and CSS code for a webpage have been updated to:
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible.
- Demonstrate logical HTML structure
- Modify or add markup to improve user experience with assistive technologies.
- Increase future code maintainability.

Web Accessibility is a broad and deep subject.  This project only attempts to address very basic aspects of accessibility.
